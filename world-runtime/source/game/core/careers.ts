/**
 * Careers: real jobs inside IlluminatED London.
 *
 * Every workplace has roles on a ladder (entry → senior → manager). You get
 * hired through a short interview, work simulated shifts in uniform, and each
 * shift is five role-based practice tasks: giving change, booking appointments,
 * fixing a failing function, writing SQL, or spotting issues in a scenario.
 * Tasks practise skills, but do not represent real employment or accredited
 * assessment; CV wording identifies the experience as simulated.
 *
 * Pure and seeded: the same seed always produces the same shift.
